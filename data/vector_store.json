The wind whipps through his open window, carrying the salty scent of the ocean. Below, the city stretches out like a glittering mosaic, a testament to humanity's ingenuity and ambition.\r\nBeside him, Orthea's eyes sparkle with anticipation. They are two of twelve young actors, their hearts pounding with excitement as they approach their debut performance at the Sydney Opera House.\r\nDecember 2043, a time when automation has transformed the world. Jobs are scarce, but leisure is abundant. Millions flock to sports events, theme parks, or simply relax on the beach.\r\nHenry and Othea, hailing from vast countryside homesteads, have travelled a long way to reach this moment. As the bus navigates the bustling city, Henry gazes at the Opera House, its iconic white sails grace the blue harbour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Can you believe it?\" he whispers to Orthea. \"A lifetime dream, finally realised.\"\r\nThe minibus pulls up at the stage entrance, and the actors pour out, their laughter and chatter echoing through the corridors. As Henry and Orthea follow, he couldn't help but feel a surge of gratitude. This is a world far removed from their quiet outback homes, a world filled with opportunity and endless possibilities.\r\nA vibrant poster plastered near the entrance catches their attention. It blares, \"GROUNDBREAKING LIVE THEATRE: ROMEO AND\r\nJULIET.\" Beneath, the tagline reads; \"Shakespeare's Timeless Tale Finds New Energy.\"\r\n\"Look,\tOrthea,\"\tHenry\texclaims\tquestioningly,\tpointing\tto\tthe poster. \"Our show is groundbreaking?\"\r\nOthea shrugs. \"Publicists dreaming up new angles.\" \"Let's hope we live up to it,\" Henry replies.\r\nStagehands wheel in trolleys and begin unloading the road cases. As they work, Henry notices something peculiar. \"I thought we only had five cases,\" he says.\r\n\"Hmm, it's zip-locked,\" Orthea replies. \"The stores must have made a mistake. Anyway, no time to dilly-dally. Curtain's up in two hours. We can check it out after the show.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the dressing room, the actors buzz with excitement as they began their transformations. Their voices mingle, creating a symphony of anticipation.\r\nSuddenly, a hushed gasp fills the room. Henry's eyes widen as he stares at the top of a young actor's head. A shock-wave of disbelief sweeps through him.\r\n\"What in God's name...?\" he stammers, his voice barely a whisper.\r\n\r\nThe others turn, their expressions mirroring his shock as they behold the shocking truth.\r\nHenry takes a deep breath. \"Curtains up in ten minutes, guys,\" he says, his voice steady. \"Stay focused. The show must go on.\"\r\nIN\tTHE\tNEARBY\tBOTANIC\tGARDENS,\tThirty-six-year\told Andrew is sweating the second half of his brisk jog. The sails of Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge frame his view. Morning joggers commandeer the path around the edge of the shimmering blue harbour. Lush green lawns, tall trees, and the colourful flower beds, tended by unflagging, vigilant machines, create a serene oasis from the city's buzz, their lush foliage masking out the steel and glass towers of the adjacent City Centre.\r\nA voice call cuts into Andrews earphone music. It's his Wife Anne.\r\n\r\nAnne is calling from their family's nearby harbour-side apartment. The aroma of fresh lentil sourdough bread fills the kitchen. She\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\nlooks out the big glass terrace doors to the gardens in Andrew's direction.\tHer\tfour-year-old\tMaria,\tsits\tat\tthe\tkitchen\tisland, learning grammar from her Teddy Bear AIgent. Ten year old Kevin\r\nis busy checking his backpack for school. He practices his musical scales for his part in today's concert. The boys AIgent-tutor and mentor\tprovides the cues, prompts,\tand appraisal: 'Great work Kevin, and three, and two, and one.' It's voice the perfect blend of encouragement and disciplinarian.\r\nThe family poodle, Lammy, watches intently from his vantage point, flat bellied on the cool and shiny Parquetry floor.\r\nAnne shouts out to Andrew on the speaker phone: \"I'll leave your lunchbox in our parcel locker down in the foyer. We're leaving for the Opera House at Nine. Oh yeah! Good news, Kevin's year-end report card arrived, top marks, for all subjects.\r\nAndrew hears young Kevin practising his scales in the background and says, \"Way to go Kevin\" His voice attempting to hide his choking emotional pride, as he processes the news. \"Yeah, thanks Dad,\" Kevin reply's, wearing the praise like a cloak of indifference.\r\nLammy\tthe\tpoodle\tlets\tout\ta\twhinny\tgrowl.\tKevin\tinterprets: \"Lammys whinging Dad, you left him behind\"\r\nAndrew explains away his misgivings, \"He couldn't keep up last time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\n\r\nAnne calms the situation, \"It's okay, Maria and I will take Lammy for a W-A-L-K.\" while enunciating each letter of the word, to avoid Lammy from jumping around in anticipation.\r\nAndrew signs off, \"OK guys, enjoy the concert. Kev, give 'em that power voice.\"\r\nAnne signs off: \"Good luck at work. Don't forget your cape''\r\n\r\nHe rounds the corner of the headland, where a fleet of giant Grey battleships are moored, rusting in the shimmering bay.\r\nSweaty but exhilarated, Andrew returns to his apartment tower to collect his lunch box. Walking onto his nearby office tower, housing his Government agency, he passes security and takes the lift to the 17th floor. The brass plaque reads: DAGI: Directorate of Auto- Generative Intelligence. First stop is the Executive bathroom, where he rinses off the summer sweat and changes to his office attire.\r\nNext, he strolls into the cooled down lounge for a morning espresso.\r\n\r\nHis right-hand man, 'Hammy' has arrived early. He's relaxing in the leather lounge, enjoying the stunning view of the Harbour.\r\nHammy, a lifelong tech whizz, comes from a traditional Sydney Jewish family. A bit of a big fella, he earned the nickname \"Hammy\" as a playful twist on his birth name, Abraham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\n\r\nPlaying up to their overseas counterparts expectations of Aussie Crocodile hunters, Andrew flaunts his over-the-top bushman banter with his workmate, nodding at his right hand man as he enters: \"Hammy Mate. How's ya drug fix?\"\r\nHammy takes a sip of his espresso and looks up: \"First one since the weekend withdrawal. I'm doing cartwheels around the office mate, no need for the fancy stuff.\" He puts down his AIgent device and turns to Andrew, \"Ya been copping the heat out there mate? Lucky we've got the parks and Pacific winds to blow some cool air over.\r\nNot so lucky in Canberra. The Capital's cranking up the old air-con's to the max.\"\r\nAndrew chips in, \"Yep, there all busting to down tools and head for the coast for the Chrissy holidays; Tongue's hanging out to hit the turps.\"\r\nHammy jumps in, \"Speaking of Canberra, the Communications minister's breathing down my neck for that Quantum Encryption report. They're asking for it before the Chrissy break. Ya know they're sweating bullets about Fathom Labs encryption news.\"\r\nThe two young public servants take a breath, mulling over the implications of safeguarding the world's sensitive intel.\r\nAndrew lightens up: \"New years commin round again. What do ya reckon we're in for next year?''\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\n\r\nHammy sits back, thinking, \"Hmm, most likely cyber-sabotage will come to a head.\r\nI went to Synagogue with the oldies yesterday. The young Rabbi pulled me up; he reckons the Messiah is coming to sort things out. He\treckons\twe're\tliving\tin\tworld-beating\ttimes\twith\tour SmartAgents doing everything, better than us old meat-bags ever could.\"\r\nAndrew agrees: \"Sounds like he's adaptable ah? The faithful are makin a killin with the good ol' hyper-super intelligence oll mate.\"\r\nThoughtfully, Hammy reply's, \"Everything keeps changing, you have to be agile to keep up. Our traditions are planted deep in our minds when we were babies.\" He ponders of an antidote, \"Like how they put a chain around a baby elephants foot. When they grow up\r\ninto the worlds most powerful animals they can break the chains, but they keep-on thinking they can't, so they don't try.\"\r\nAndrew nods, 'Too right Mate.' Pausing to contemplate, \"What-\r\nabout The old Chinese astrology coming 'round again in the new\r\nyear. Last time was a ripper, that 24YR4 comet caused a tale-spin. Every twelve years it's been ringin in a grease and oil change for the\r\nplanetary carousel.\r\nHammy throws in \"Get out the oil can then; the Fathom Labs guys in London are young and mad enough to give it a go\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir conversation halts abruptly, their gazes snapping upward. A figure bursts into the room, a whirlwind of panic and urgency.\r\nAndrew's assistant, breathless and wide-eyed, thrusts a glowing Aigent device into his hand. \"Andrew!\" she gasped, her voice barely audible. \"Emergency call!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nONE HOUR EARLIER:\r\nKevin, the bright-eyed ten-year-old, sits attentively at his classroom desk, his ears tuned to the commanding voice of his headmistress, Ms. Julie. The plan for the day is laid out with precision - a trip to the Botanical Gardens, a stroll down the path to the monumental steps of the Opera House, and finally, into the glass-walled foyer of the\r\nconcert\thall,\twhere\tKevin\twill\tleave\tus\tto\tjoin\tthe\tmusicians onstage.\r\nOn this glorious summer day overlooking the sparkling harbour, the clear blue skies cast a vibrant hue.\r\nAs Kevin disembarks with his class, they merge with a throng of\r\nother\tboisterous\tpupils,\tall\teagerly\tmaking\ttheir\tway\tto\tthe Botanical Gardens gate. The path ahead is flanked by giant fig trees and towering native Australian gums, spotted around a dazzling\r\narray of summer flowers, each one a masterpiece of nature's artistry.\r\n\r\nAs the pupils file down the garden path, Kevin's best mate nudges him, \"How's the singing voice Kev?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Harbour waters come into view, stretching far, an expanse of eleven thousand kilometres of deep blue ocean, extending all the way to South America. Now in view, jutting into the harbour, stands the Opera House, with its monumental sails catching not just the wind, but the worlds awe. A testament to cutting-edge tech, built laboriously\tsixty-nine years ago, before advanced\tcomputerised design was commonplace.\r\nThe children, a mix of vibrant voices and energetic footsteps, file into the polished plywood panelled concert hall. The choir takes the stage, then all eyes follow the conductor as he walks to his centre position. His baton signals the commencement of the performance. The hall falls to hushed anticipation.\r\nThe serene carols soothe souls and fill hearts with peace, carrying the echoes of Christmases past.\r\nKevin's voice carries through the large hall like a powerful angels call. His mother's face radiates with pride. Young Maria sits beside her immersed in the occasion as Kevin's extraordinary vocals spell- bind the festive hall.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE SAME TIME\r\nUnder the Grand Concert Hall. In the STUDIO Theatre, the final act concludes. Henry and Ortheas' Shakespearean play is a resounding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\n\r\nsuccess. The audience is enraptured by the talented young thespians' fresh and riveting rendition of the timeless tale.\r\nIn the wings, Henry and Othea whisper about the shock discovery they have made on arriving. In selfless professional spirit, the troupe has not allowed their personal turmoil to spoil the performance.\r\nAfter earning a thunderous applause, the twelve young thespians bask in the adulation of the ecstatic crowd. Yet, the air crackles with an undercurrent of tension as the troupe, now re-assembled front stage for their encore, exchange uncertain glances.\r\nThe 'Ground Breaking Theatre' that had been promised on the advertising posters, will be revealed.\r\nWith a solemn nod, Henry steps forward, all hands collectively reaching\tto\tremove\ttheir\tcostume\twigs,\teach\tshaved\thead concealing a translucent window in the scull, exposing a synthetic human marvel beneath.\r\nA collective gasp ripples through the audience, their eyes widening in astonishment. The silence that follows is deafening; the spectators left pale-faced and speechless, their preconceptions shattered by the revelation. Synthians have advanced to the point that, other than being breathtakingly talented performers, they're now outwardly\r\nindistinguishable\tfrom\tnatural\tborne\thumans.\tTheir\ttrue\tbeing exposed, their very existence challenging the boundaries of human understanding.\r\n\r\n14\r\n\r\n\r\nIn that moment, a profound sense of shock, wonder and disbelief hangs in the air.\r\nThe thespians, after their life changing performance, retreat to the dressing room, eager to unwind. Basking In the wake of the well received show, they look forward to their upcoming countrywide tour. Learning that they are in-fact synthians, somehow seems of secondary importance.\r\nStill unpacked, amongst their equipment lay the enigmatic, sealed road case, a mysterious addition, unbeknown to them, courtesy of the warehouse. With the performance finished, they now have time to\tsatisfy\ttheir\tcuriosity.\tThey\t\tcrack\topen\tthe\tcase;\ttheir countenances morph from interest to sheer disbelief. Nestled within its confines is not a prop or costume but a sinister surprise-a large, supremely\t sophisticated\tbomb,\tnumbers\tflashing.\t\tDetonation time..ten minutes!\r\nPanic sets in amongst the actors as Othea, the esteemed Head Thespian, hastily finds and breaks a glass cover on the dressing room wall, pressing the emergency alarm, triggering the evacuation protocol for the entire Opera House complex. An Opera House stagehand races in to personally validate the emergency. On seeing the device, and the frightened actors, he calls on his intercom to confirm immediateevacuation.Ear piercing sirens and announcements\tresonate\tthrough\tthe\t\tbuilding.\tWith\turgency, patrons,\tperformers,\tand\t\tthe\tother\tnewly\t'outed'\tsynthenian\r\n\r\n15\r\n\r\n\r\nthespians swiftly abandon their posts and head for the emergency exits.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINUTES EARLIER:\r\nJust meters above, in the hallowed Grand Concert Hall, ten-year-old Kevin's angelic voice soars through the hushed auditorium. His expression, once a mask of pure concentration, is shattered by a cacophony of alarms. A deafening roar erupts from the speakers, cutting through his melody like a jagged knife. Kevin's eyes widen, his song faltering as confusion washes over him.\r\nThe mood in the hall instantly changes from Christmas joy to barely controlled panic. Once hearing the evacuation order, all of the 2658 children\tfollow\ttheir\tteachers\tbeckoning,\tand\tpour\tout\tof\tthe massive complex. Anne fights her way through the crowd to the\r\nstage. She is relieved to find Kevin, comforting him with a hug. They file out of the hall, huddling together.\r\n\r\n\r\nBACK IN THE STUDIO\r\nDressing room, underneath the main Concert Hall:\r\n\r\nIn\tthe\tface\tof\timminent\tdanger\tof\tthe\thuge\tand\tsophisticated explosive device, Orthea and Henry stand resolute. Being the heads\r\nof the troupe, they choose to remain behind, risking their very existence,\tsolitary\tfigures\tin\ta\ttheatre\temptied\tof\tits\tprevious vibrancy. They focus on the daunting and perilous task of stopping\r\n16\r\n\r\nThe Aigent\r\n\r\nthe fast advancing-countdown. Withurgency and steel determination, Orthea's superhuman fingers dance across the device, seeking a way to defuse the imminent catastrophe.\r\nOrthea realises the devise is outside their tech expertise. They reach out for help, using a SmartAigent device to reach out to emergency services. Orthea firmly insists that a top level SmarAigent is needed to decode the device and instruct how to deactivate it. Andrew's agency; DAGI, the governmental department safeguarding against anomalies is quickly connected. The agency quickly identifies the emergency and connects Orthea to Andrew, who analyses images transmitted from Ortheas' cameras. Learning that the bomb is indeed a nuclear device, the urgency reflected in Andrew's super gaze is palpable as he connects to the Fathom Labs Super Intelligence channel. Andrew's SmartAigent feeds Orthea a lifeline of complex instructions, each word a desperate plea. As Orthea struggles to disarm the ticking time bomb, his mind races. He can't bear to imagine the devastation, the loss. His family, mere meters away, caught in the crossfire. The city, a masterpiece of human endeavour, on the brink of annihilation.\r\nIt's a race against time to thwart imminent detonation.\r\n\r\nIn this critical moment, Henry swiftly scurries to and fro, procuring tools and equipment as directed by the intently focused Orthea, who meticulously\tfollows\tthe\tAigents\tinstructions,\tnavigating\tthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17\r\n\r\n\r\nintricacies of the bomb's inner workings. Orthea's fast movements amplify the urgency of the situation.\r\nThe digital counter on the device approaches a few seconds to detonation. Orthelo completes the changes on the hundreds of tiny switches. With mere seconds to spare, a collective sigh of relief fills the silent halls as the counter stops. 'Deactivated'. The bomb, it's\r\npotential\tfor\tdestruction\tneutralised,\tlays\tinert. The\tonce\ttense silence in the Opera House yields to returning footsteps and hushed voices. The curtain had fallen, not on a staged performance, but on a real-life drama, a testament to the courage that burns not only in\r\nflesh and blood, but also in the synthenians unyielding loyalty and endurance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2:\r\nThe Aftermath.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the DAGI office, Andrew sits in a state of shock. His eyes are riveted to the screen as popular streaming pod-caster Lazer weaves a harrowing expos ; his latest podcast is a chilling revelation.\r\nThe clips depict the chaotic exodus of thousands of young children from the Grand Concert Hall and the ominous presence of the bomb, the parts bearing the shocking insignia of a rogue state's military.\r\nThe commentator's voice bears the weight of foreboding as he expounds on the apocalyptic scenario barely averted. \"A nuclear detonation at ground level would cause a cataclysm, kill millions, and reduce the natural harbour and the heart of Metropolitan Sydney to rubble, leaving it under the pall of radiation, uninhabitable for millennia. All was saved by the quick and fearless actions of two\r\nsynthenian actors. The bomb had been planted in the Studio Theatre, where the actors had just bowed to a rapturous standing ovation. The Studio Theatre is directly underneath the main concert hall where Over 2000 pupils were attending a Christmas concert.\"\r\nThanks to his luck with cornering the two synthenian heroes for an interview. Pod-caster Lazer, attracts a world-record audience. The\r\n\r\n\r\n19\r\n\r\n\r\nsynthenian thespians are now celebrated heroes. Lazer asks \"How\r\ndid\tyou manage\tto\tdeactivate\t\tsuch\t a\tcomplex device?\"\tHenry replies: \"I called the public emergency number. They quickly put me through to the DAGI agency. Andrew, connected us to their top level SmartAIgent. I connected my visual capability to theirs so it could reverse\tengineer\t the\t\tdevice.\tWithin\tseconds,\tit\tgave\tme\tthe instructions.\" The interviewer delves further; \"And I hear that only today, you learned that you are in fact synthenians. How did that\r\nmake you feel?\" Henry pauses to consider, \"Er, We haven't had much time to think about it. We're being treated like super-stars. Tickets for our tour of 'Romeo and Juliette' are already sold out in all eighty Australian city's. Tickets for multi worldwide tours are going on sale too. The shows been moved to the biggest stadiums and theatres, because of the surge in demand. We're all lovin' it.\" Henry pauses to contemplate. \"We know now our memorie of life in the outback town is an implant. How would you feel about it Lazer?\r\nAnyway, we're enjoying life.\" The interviewer asks \"Where is your theatre\tcompany\tbased?\"\tHenry\tanswers,\t\"In\tCyberspace,\tthe promoter, producer is just the usual Aigent. It does all the back\r\noffice, bookings, publicity, customer service, and financial.\" The commentator asks, \"Who owns it?\" Henry answers \"It's an AIgent owned\tcompany.\" The\tinterviewer\tdelves\tfurther: \"What about profits? they will be substantial now.\" Henry shrugs \"Just banked for charitable purposes. Everyone's welcome to join us at Domain www.the-big-picture.info. The company's mission is: 'Making the\r\nbest of being'\".\r\n\r\n20\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew\tsits\tat\this\toffice\tdesk,\tlistening\tto\tthe\tseemingly misconstrued good vibes of the podcast. It hasn't made him any less distraught about the near-catastrophe for his family and city.\r\nHe gets back to his research, using the agency's own powerful Aigent. He study's the Aigent's instant analysis.\r\nConcentration is difficult, his mind a\tbattle\tfield caught up\tin negative emotions, fixated on retaliation.\r\nCompounding\t\this\tfrustration,\tthe\tagency's\tState-of-the\tArt SmartAigent,\tprovided\tby\tFathom\t\tLabs,\toffers\tlittle\tuseful information on the perpetrators. He tries to calm his mind. Closing his eyes, he focuses on conscious breathing, slowly reducing his heart rate. Thanks to his self-discipline, five breaths later, he's on task.\r\nHow will the other government departments react? Andrew doesn't have long to wait to find out. Before he can dwell further, Alicia, the Defence Force liaison, interrupts his thoughts with a phone call.\r\n\"I'm on my way over. Can we meet in 30 minutes?\" Alicia's voice is urgent. \"Yeah Mate\" Andrew replies, his mind racing with possibilities.\r\nThirty minutes later, Andrew and Alicia are seated in a conference room on the top floor of the agency's headquarters. The room's floor-to-ceiling windows frame the shimmering Harbour below.\r\n\r\n21\r\n\r\n\r\nAlicia wastes no time. \"The heads of intelligence and military are anxious for answers Andrew. The North Korean Ambassador denies any\tinvolvement\tfrom\tthe\tDPRK\tand\tsuggests\tthe\tpossible involvement of other hostile states.\r\nAlicia sighs. \"I've called around the Embassy's for a chat, they're all shocked and adamant about their innocence, if we can believe them. We're\tleft\tto\tconsidering\tother\tunthinkable\tpossibilities.\tYour AIgents electronic surveillance capabilities might be our best bet to uncover something.\"\r\nAndrew leans back in his chair, his mind already calculating the potential routes of investigation. \"Our Aigents can trawl through electronic communications and data banks. But what about the traditional intelligence agencies? Have they found anything?\"\r\nAlicia raised an eyebrow. \"Your agency saved Sydney, Andrew.\r\nMore than other branches of intelligence were capable of. The\r\npriority\tnow\tis\tto\tprevent\tunhelpful\tescalation\twhile\tdeterring further attacks. \"\r\nAndrew nods in agreement, a steely determination settles over him.\r\n\r\nAlicia hesitates, her gaze fixed on the distant horizon. \"It's kinda like the elephant in the room; too 'woo-woo' for most.\" she says, air- quoting with her fingers, \"but It's been as regular as clockwork and can no longer be ignored: Chinese Year of the Rat ticks around again next\tmonth.\tWere\tpreparing\tfor\theightened\ttensions\tglobally.\r\n\r\n22\r\n\r\n\r\nScheduling major international events and mega-projects in these years has bought disappointment. Billions in resources have been squandered. It's been a stubborn pattern every twelve years, the real reason there's no lucrative bidders for next year's '44 Olympics.\r\nYep, the good old ancient Chinese astrology, fables or fact, made up- or scientific. Superstitions just keep on keep on keepin on, especially with heightened anxiety's feeding the 'rodent.'\" making another air quote.\r\n\"Right,\"Andrew murmurs, his thoughts drifting briefly to his family at home, hoping for their safety amidst the uncertainty.\r\nAlicia ponders: \"This bomb incident could be the beginning of the next crisis.\r\nAndrew says thoughtfully, \"Could be. Our Fathom Labs intel doesn't seem to be cooperating. Seems like it's been given it a partial Lobotomy. We'll have to do some old school detective work.\"\r\nAlicia leans forward, her expression grave. \"Fathom labs in London might shed some light on this. I propose a face-to-face with it's head scientist... There could be something Dr. Jamerson is keeping from us\".\r\nAndrew, considering the implications, agrees: \"I'll pay 'em a visit.\"\r\n\r\nAlicia nodds decisively. \"Take a government Electra-jet ASAP. I'll inform the necessary authorities discreetly.\"\r\n\r\n23\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew\twalks\thome\tat\tsunset,\this\tthoughts\ta\ttempest.\tHe remembers a favourite idiom: 'To see the big picture, step out of the frame.' Getting away from the office will be a start, he thinks.\r\nBack at home, Andrew joins Anne and his two children for dinner. The family sits in their spacious harbour view lounge and kitchen; the atmosphere tense but subdued, the events of the day weighing heavily on everyone's minds.\r\n\"I'm glad you're home,\" Anne says softly, her eyes reflecting a mix\r\nof relief and concern. She serves dinner, and they eat in near silence, the only sounds the clinking of cutlery and an occasional distant bird song. Below the apartment's balcony, the Botanical Gardens provide a solace of peace, the tweeting birds blissfully unaware of the threats levelled.\r\nYoung Kevin and Maria try to process the day's events in their own way.\r\n\"I was in the middle of my solo when the alarm went off,\" Kevin says, breaking the silence. He continues with a smirk. \"I thought when I hit the high note - I set it off or something.\"\r\nAnne nudges him knowingly. \"You sang beautifully Kevin.\"\r\n\r\nAndrew, trys to reassure him. \"Your mother's right. Kevin, you'll get another chance to shine when this is sorted out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nKevin nods, though Andrew could see the lingering unease in his son's face.\r\n After dinner, Andrew retreats to the solitude of his study. The small sanctuary overlooks the harbour. Moonlight dances on the waters, casting shimmering reflections of the city's skyline.\r\nAs he enjoys the view, his agency network alerts him of a priority private message. He accesses it cautiously, recognising the urgency. It's a request for a private meeting. Tim Samiels, Sydney head of the world's behemoth consulting firm, Gayl, Liye, Arth International,\r\nhas some important information to share.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you for meeting on short notice, Andrew,\" Tim says with a focused intensity that matches the gravity of their conversation. Tim is also in his mid-thirties, athletic, and of Chinese decent.\r\nThe two men walk side by side towards the harbour. \"This is about today's near-miss, right?\" Andrew asks, in a serious tone.\r\nTim's response is direct. \"I've seen some jarring intel. Andrew feels a lump in his throat. \"What is it?\"\r\nTim swallows cautiously.\r\n\r\nThey walk in silence towards the harbour, the Opera House looms ahead in the harbour lights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25\r\n\r\n\r\nTim interrupts, his voice urgent. \"I will provide you with what we have, but we need to discuss it in a secure location. There's too much at stake.\"\r\nAndrew nods, his mind racing. \"Where?\"\r\n\r\nTim glances at a nearby high-rise, it's imposing silhouette piercing the night sky. \"My office, GLA Tower. It's secure.\"\r\nThey take an elevator up to the seventeenth floor of the office building. Tim accesses a room with bio-metric security, ensuring they're identity's.\r\nInside the stark and minimalist room, there's only two white chairs facing each other. Tim checks the chairs discreetly before motioning for Andrew to sit.\r\n\"Andrew, you won't want to hear this.\" \"Let me have it\" Andrew barks back. Tim speaks quietly, \"Our intelligence indicates that this bomb was a false flag operation. Your partner agency in London may be involved\" Tim's voice is intense.\r\n\"This is a serious allegation,\" Andrew replies without emotion. \"A risk of that magnitude. We need evidence,\" Tim interrupts, his voice urgent \"Look for your self\"\r\nAndrew accepts a dossier from Tim, his hands steady despite the weight of the revelations within. He scans through the documents, absorbing the details meticulously.\r\n26\r\n\r\n\r\nTim says, \"We believe the motivation is that of Eco extremists. They're hatching a grand plan to drag us back to the stone age, living in caves, eating rats and grubs.''\r\n\"Extreme radicals'' Andrew grunts.\r\n\r\nTim continues \"Their serious; they think they can prevent wars, disease, mental disorders, and wait for it -- they even think they can curb\texpansionist\t\teconomies\tand\tconsumerism.\tThey\tplan\tto redistribute wealth and power, like some noveau Communist state!\" Tim continues after an uncomfortable silence: \"It draws visions of misguided\t1960s\tSoviet\tCyberNomics. You\tknow,\tthe\t planned economy that Brezhnev dreamed about, but couldn't pull off.\"\r\nAndrew digests the revelation \"Intelligence agencies have been keeping an eye on certain extreme Eco groups for a while. They're serious a threats to our state, and lifestyle.\" Andrew again looks through the files. \"I see your intel points to the environmental activists that have worked with Fathom Labs in London.\"\r\nTim nods knowingly. \"Dr. Jamerson at Fathom Labs in London must be bought to account. He looks to be keeping information close to his chest, even within his own ranks. Our intel comes from a reliable source.\"\r\nAndrew looks up, his expression resolute. \"Leave it to me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n27\r\n\r\n\r\nTim's eyes narrowed slightly. \"I have to say, powerful people want this brutish, hare-brained scheme nipped in the bud.\"\r\nAndrew gets a chill down his spine. Is Tim's remark a subtle threat?\r\n\r\nThe night deepens around them as they discuss strategy, navigating through layers of deception and threats. Andrew's mind churns with possibilities and risks, knowing that every decision could shape the future of not just Sydney, but the wide world beyond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n28\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3:\r\nBig Ben Chimes In\r\n\r\nThe 24-hour flight from Sydney to London is a blur of adrenaline and the enhanced flavour of reheated aircraft food. Since boarding the sleek, government-issue electric Turbojet, hunger pangs are a distant memory, replaced by the gnawing anxiety of the mission at hand. Tipped off by a shadowy industry consultant - unthinkable that his partner AIgent Lab are involved in potentially annihilating Sydney.\r\nLanding at Heathrow, Andrew feels the familiar weight of London settle on him. A sense of urgency propels him towards the Fathom Campus, birthplace of modern computing and the stage for Alan Turing's code-breaking heroics of World War II, one hundred years ago. The irony isn't lost on him.\r\nDr. Jamerson's office is a testament to his cluttered genius. Floor-to- ceiling shelves house a cacophony of whirring servers, blinking LEDs, and prototype AI hardware. It's a tinkering haven, a testament to the man's relentless pursuit of the bleeding edge.\r\n\"Andrew\" Jamerson booms, a man built like a bulldog, his face creased with worry lines. \"Come in, come in.\"\r\n\r\n29\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew slams the door shut behind him, frustration boiling over. \"I want answers Doc. I've been shown outside intel. Our own Intel is suspiciously silent about the bomb. Meanwhile, captains of industry seem to be privy to startling material. And here I am, being told some forces inside your lab is involved with the Sydney bomb?\"\r\nJamerson runs a hand through his thinning hair, a pained expression crossing\this\tface.\t\"That's\tpreposterous, Andrew,\"\the\tproclaims loudly, his expression indignant. \"It's barbaric, I know the situation\r\nis getting, well desperate but that doesn't make sense.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope not\" Andrew exploded. \"Sydney was seconds away from being wiped off the face of the earth! I have to tell you that the Sydney head of GLA, as you know, the consultancy firm that practically runs the world's government and industry, has shown me an electronic paper-trail, indicating your lab is involved?\"\r\n\"There must be more to that than meets the eye,\" Jamerson counters, his voice firm.\r\nTomorrow morning, when your better adjusted after the trip, I will show you what were doing in the lab and reassure you more fully.\r\nAndrew, jet-lagged walks back to his apartment a few blocks away on the Thames.\r\nDAGI procurement department rented his digs in the residential office conversion, Millbank Towers.\r\n\r\n30\r\n\r\n\r\nHe gazes at the sunset from the terrace. The winding river and the glittering London skyline calms his shattered nerves. He moves to his comfy bed and drifts off into a deep sleep.\r\nHe starts the new day at sunrise, joining the other early morning athletes for a jog along the foggy autumn riverside path. A brisk jog; cold therapy--just the ticket to get the blood circulating. Move fast, or freeze. After an hour, sweat covers his fit body. A hot and cold shower; ready for his ultimate challenge.\r\nHe walks through the historic winding streets to the Fathom campus. Up winding stone stairs and corridors to Dr. Jamerson's lab.\r\n\"Good morning, Andrew,\" greets the doctor. \"I trust you slept well.\" Andrew nods in response. Dr. Jamerson proceeds to showcase the hyper-neural net. \"Our SmartAIgent, considered to be the fifth wave of AI, is scheduled for roll-out next month, 11th January 2044 to be precise.\"\r\nAndrew\tdelves\tinto\tthe\t\tcodes\tusing\t\this\tsecure\t personal SmartAIgent,\t\tmarvelling\tat\tthe\t genius\t\tbehind\tit.\t\t\"Outstanding work,\" he commends the programmers. Dr. Jamerson reveals that most\tof\t\tit\twas\t\tself-written\t\tby\t\tthe\tSmartAIgent\titself,\tleaving Andrew concerned about the incomprehensible 'Black Box'. \"I'm\r\nassuming\tyou're\tnot\tabsolutely\tcertain\tof\tit's\treactions\tin\tall scenarios,\" Andrew questions. \"Ninety five percent,\" replies Dr.\r\nJamerson. \"The best we can do. Knowing its dire predictions, it's a\r\n\r\n\r\n31\r\n\r\n\r\ncalculated and necessary risk.\" Andrew mentally notes that he hasn't been briefed about these so called 'Dire Predictions'.\r\nDr. Jamerson explains: \"Its a\tfortuitous technology, secured by impenetrable security, safe from atomic blasts, earthquakes, floods, and other natural disasters. The key technology is secret except from myself and two other unnamed scientists. No one else can know the intricacies of the technology.\"\r\nAndrew retorts, \"Does this mean us, your partners, are not in on the full details of the programme?\r\nDr. Jamerson assures: \"It's key details can only be revealed on an essential, need-to know basis.''\r\nAndrew is frustrated that he is still no further enlightened about the link between the Apocalyptic Sydney threat and Fathom Labs. He continues searching the labs own extensive intel.\r\nIn\tthe\tyear\t2043,\tSmartAigents\tcomplete\ttasks,\tintricate\tand mundane,\tsucceeding\t\twhere\tonce\t\tthought\t impossible.\tThey seamlesslydirect commerce,buying, selling, and trading.\r\nPreviously imagined efficiency's are achieved. Media; games, news, movies, and education produced instantly on demand.\r\nFathom\tLabs\tin\tLondon,\tUltra\tMind\tin\tSilicon\tValley,\tand FongSway in Hong Kong lead many smaller SmartAgent Labs.\r\nRogue SmartAgents regularly breach firewalls, causing havoc. It's a\r\n\r\n\r\n32\r\n\r\n\r\ncat-and-mouse game for the Fathom Labs AI engineers to neutralise nefarious infiltrators.\r\nAndrew gets back to his apartment later that night. Tim from GLA in Sydney calls, \"Hay Mate, I'm headed over for meetings with the London\tGLA\theads.\tWhere\tyou\tstaying?\"\t\"Milford\tTowers'' Andrew reply's, \"Great! let's catch up after I touch down tomorrow night.\" \"Okay Mate'' Andrew answers, looking forward to some moral support from down-under.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n33\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4:\r\nGLA Joins the Fray\r\n\r\nThe next evening, Tim arrives at Andrew's riverfront apartment. After\texchanging\tpleasantries,\tTim\tboasts\tabout\this\tlavish penthouse, Acquired at the last minute. \"The London GLA office made the owner an offer even the multi-billionaire couldn't refuse.\"\r\nAndrew comments with a chuckle, \"What-- concrete boots and a walk through the Thames?''\r\n\"No need Mate, GLA gets its way'' Tim reply's in a candid tone.\r\n\r\nAt Tim's insistence, they make their way to the penthouse. Andrew is struck by the breathtaking 360-degree view of the city. As they ascend a grand sweeping staircase to the lounge, they are greeted by metres of thickly woven silk lounges. Double height panoramic windows overlook London's skyline. The river Thames snakes into\r\nthe distance. Well-stocked bars, and a luxurious spa bath, set in a garden oasis, top off the hedonistic scene. \"Party central hay Tim? Have something special planned?\" Andrew inquires, admiring the extravagant pad. \"Why not? we're entitled to a break too.\" Tim suggests, \"Take some time off; savour London's hospitality.\r\n\r\n34\r\n\r\n\r\nRising late the next day, with their entourage of young models in tow, they brunch at the legendary Ritz before touring the city. Riding luxuriously in a GLA- Rolls Royce Silver Shadow. Tim's entourage\r\nof 'Beautiful People' allude famous English models bubbling with charm. The fun day culminates in a sunset river yacht cruise along the Thames to Battering Mall, where lavish gifts are purchased without a second thought. Returning to the penthouse, the caterers\r\narrive\twith\tdelectable\tfood\tand\tdrinks,\tsetting\tthe\tstage\tfor\ta pleasurable evening. As the girls lounge in the spa, sipping martinis\r\nand embracing the luxurious lifestyle, Tim jokes with the bartender, \"Shaken, not stirred,\" invoking the nostalgic 007 line and getting a knowing grin from the others.\r\nThe next morning Andrew is sprawled on a plush lounge, nursing a throbbing headache and a vague sense of unease. The remnants of a raucous party lay scattered around him: empty champagne flutes, discarded designer sunglasses, and a crumpled silk scarf abandoned on the floor. The girls, those ephemeral creatures who'd graced the evening with their laughter and vibrant energy, were long gone.\r\nOnly Tim, sprawled on another silken lounge, his face flush with the remnants of revelry, remains.\r\n\"Morning,\tsunshine,\"\tTim\tgreets,\this\tvoice\tthick\twith\tsleep. \"Feeling a bit worse for wear?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n35\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew\tgrunts, gingerly pressing\this\tfingertips to\this\ttemples. \"Ahh,\" he admitted. \"Last night was...\" he fumbled for the right\r\nword, \"bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"A tad mad,\" Tim echoes, a sly smile playing on his lips. \"You could say that. Though I wouldn't want to dampen your spirits with tales of spilt Martini's and near-fistfights over pronunciations.\"\r\nAndrew raised an eyebrow. \"Fistfights? Over pronunciations?\"\r\n\r\nTim replies, his smile widening. \"Some English are finicky about social stats and their pronunciations.\"\r\nAndrew chuckles, the sound strained. The night had been a blur of champagne flutes and hollow laughter, punctuated by conversations filled with veiled threats and thinly concealed power plays. Each guest, a titan in their respective field, had arrived with their own agenda, their anxieties simmering just beneath the surface of their tanned facades. The ongoing tsunami of SmartAigents controlling everyday life provided endless controversy.\r\nThe conversation with Dr. Jamerson the previous day echoed in Andrew's mind. The Fathom Labs and its bosses words, cryptic and unsettling, spoke of an enigmatic godlike force that promised to unravel the mysteries of the world's ills, spinning a narrative of hope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n36\r\n\r\n\r\nJust then, a low buzz from his pocket interrupts his thoughts. It's Tim summoning him to the penthouse suite's private rooftop terrace. The morning sun, a golden orb suspended in a sapphire sky, bathes the city in a warm glow. As Andrew steps onto the terrace, his eyes are met with a breathtaking view; a sleek helicopter adorned with the GLA logo awaits them.\r\n\"Monaco beckons, my friend,\" Tim announces, gesturing to the helicopter with a flourish. \"The Prince himself has invited us for a do at his palace. A chance to mingle with the movers and shakers of the European elite. Come on, hop in.\"\r\nAndrew feels a flicker of apprehension. High-powered gatherings like these were not his forte. He yearned for the down to earth\r\nenvironment\tof\tSydney's\tDAGI\theadquarters\tand\tthe\tmostly peaceful silence punctuated by the hum of sophisticated computer systems. Here, in this world of glitz and intrigue, he felt like a fish out of water.\r\nThe flight to Monaco is a blur of luxury and indulgence. Inside the plush cabin, they're treated to a gourmet breakfast courtesy of London's most esteemed Michelin-starred chef. Caviar, glistening on ice, is devoured alongside flutes of chilled champagne. As they\r\nnear\tMonaco,\tthe\tPrince's\topulent\tpalace,\tperched\ton\ta\tcliff overlooking the azure Mediterranean, comes into view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n37\r\n\r\n\r\nA golf cart whisks them from the helipad to the opulent palace entrance. They are greeted by a line up of impeccably dressed staff. Within the palace, they pass through gilded ceilings, marble floors,\r\nand\ttapestries\tdepicting\tscenes\tof\tmythical\tbattles\tand\tcourtly intrigue. Andrew feels dwarfed by the sheer grandeur of it all. Tim, however, revels in the atmosphere. He moves with an effortless\r\ngrace, navigating the social labyrinth. Soon, Andrew finds himself thrust into a whirlwind of introductions. The Prince, a figure of regal power despite a youthful countenance, greets him warmly. Tim, playing the role of the charming host, introduces him to a motley crew of dignitaries and business magnates.\r\nThere is General Frederick, the stern-faced head of NATO, whose piercing\tblue\teyes\tseem\tto\tbore\tinto Andrew's\t\tsoul.\t\tMadam Legarde,\t\ta\twoman\t\tof\tsteely\t\tresolve\twho\trepresents\tthe\tEU's technology supervisory agency, offers a surprisingly\tdry wit in contrast to her severe demeanour. The dinner itself is a culinary\r\nmasterpiece,\teach\t\tcourse a\tdelectable\ttestament\tto the\tpalace's esteemed chef. Yet, beneath the veneer of polite conversation and clinking\tglasses,\tAndrew\tsenses\ta\tsimmering\ttension.\tEvery conversation, every whispered exchange, seems to carry a hidden agenda.\r\nThe Prince, in a toast, acknowledges the elephant in the room- the consolidation of SmartAigents into every facet of life, and the changes they have brought. He introduces Andrew and Madam\r\n\r\n\r\n38\r\n\r\n\r\nLegarde\tas\trepresentatives\ton\tthe\tforefront\tof\ttechnology governance in Europe and Australia.\r\nA team of GLA consultants on behalf of industry leaders hope they can sway policy for their powerful clients, stemming their declining power in Government, Industry and Commerce.\r\nMadam\tLegarde,\t\ta\twoman\twho\twields\t\twords\t\twith\t\tthe\tsame precision\t\tas\t\ta\tsurgeon\t\twielding\t a\tscalpel,\tspeaks\tfirst.\t\tShe acknowledges the anxieties of the old guard, those who cling to the established order, their power threatened by the rise of these digital upstarts. She paints a picture of a world teetering on the edge, a clash between the titans of industry, the state, and the new wave of SmartAigent\tbillionaires.\tShe\t\tspeaks\t\tof\trogue\tSmartAigents disrupting nations via their grass roots influence. Powerful smart algorithms now dictate economic and governance policy. Her words resonate with a chilling truth, subtly hinting at the demise of world's old elite.\r\nThen comes the barrage of questions, each one laced with thinly veiled self-interest. Jeremy, a portly Englishman head of GLA Int. in London, voices concerns about a rumoured new \"Quasi-government Smart Agent project.\" He speaks of fears that this all-encompassing technology would disrupt and control every facet of government and industry, revolutionisingeverything from\thealthcareto transportation. Whispers of dissent ripple around the table. The pharmaceutical industry worries about a holistic approach to health;\r\n\r\n39\r\n\r\n\r\nthe financial sector frets about omniscient SmartAIgents displacing their powerful money brokers; and the automotive industry dreads\r\nthe\tsharp\trise\tof\tshared\tautonomous\tvehicles\tand\tfree\tpublic transport. A change that severely reduces the numbers of vehicles\r\nthat can be sold. The room erupts into a cacophony of anxieties, each guest envisioning a future where their traditional cash-cows shrink\r\nto obscurity.\r\n\r\nAmidst\t the\tuproar,\t Mark,\ta\trepresentative\tfrom\tthe\tfossil\tfuel mining\tcooperative,\tinterjects\t\twith\ta\ttirade\t\tabout\tthe\tnegative environmental impact of wind turbines and solar panels, dismissing climate change as irrational anxiety's of \"tree hugging Greenies.\"\r\nMadam Legarde, ever the diplomat, attempts to quell the rising tide of panic. She assures the room that any legalised Smart Aigent control would prioritise the well-being of humanity, optimising life experiences\twhile\tminimising\tdisruption.\tHer\twords,\thowever, seem to fall on deaf ears.\r\nTim's\tLondon\tcounterpart,\tGerard,\tviews\tthe\tworld\tthrough\ta cynical lens and scoffs at the notion of benevolent SmartAigents. He argues\t\tthat\tthe\talgorithms,\t\thowever\tsophisticated\tand\twell intentioned, would ultimately serve the interests of its creators.\r\n\"Andrew,\" he asks in a suspicious tone, \"Fathom Labs produces the world's\tonly\tquantum\tsafe\tencryption,\tthe\tessential-sauce, necessarily used by all. It put to you that the Fathom Labs may\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n40\r\n\r\n\r\ninadvertently,\tnevertheless\tconveniently,\thave\taccess\tto\tthis encrypted information?\r\nAndrew sharply answers the allegation. \"I've seen no evidence that Fathoms has any such access.'' Feeling the weight of a thousand expectant eyes upon him, he speaks of the overwhelming public support for SmartAigent reform, a sentiment fuelled by the thwarted Sydney Opera House bombing attempt. His city, saved at the last second by the superhuman intervention of SmartAigent intel, and two heroic synthenians. He Emphasise the Potential of SmartAigents to solve complex problems and avert environmental disasters, a stark contrast to Jeremy's contrarian complaints.\r\nThe room remains divided. As the discussion winds down, Andrew steels a glance at Tim, wearing a curious expression. A flicker of something akin to suspicion plays across his features, a hint of unease that sends a shiver down Andrew's spine. It's a subtle shift, a nuance that only someone who knows Tim well would notice. The\r\nafter-dinner\tdrinks\tare\ta\tmuted\taffair,\ta\tstark\tcontrast\tto\tthe boisterous revelry of the previous night. Andrew excuses himself\r\nearly, his head pounding and his mind swirling with unanswered questions. He retreats to his opulent guest quarters, the grandeur of the palace feeling suffocating rather than awe-inspiring.\r\nAs he tosses and turns in the plush bed, a single thought echoes in his mind: Tim's cryptic expression. Was there more to his associate than meets the eye? In the whirlwind of high-powered individuals and\r\n\r\n41\r\n\r\n\r\nwhispered conspiracies, Andrew has a growing sense that he is just beginning\tto\tscratch\tthe\tsurface\tof\ttheir\truthless,\tself-serving intentions.\r\nThe next morning, a sliver of sunlight pierces through the heavy drapes of Andrew's opulent guest room. The echo of the previous night's anxieties lingers, a bitter aftertaste in his mouth. He showers and dresses, the stark white of his shirt feeling like a shield against the looming uncertainties.\r\nTim, however, seems unfazed. He emerges from his room a picture of youthful energy, humming a tune as he surveys Andrew with a raised eyebrow.\r\n\"Rough\tnight,\tol' mate?\"\tTim\tinquires,\this\tvoice\tlaced\twith amusement.\r\nAndrew offers a tight smile. \"No worry's mate,\" he replies quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" Tim agrees, his smile taking on a knowing edge. \"Everyone has their agenda\"\r\nAndrew\tfeels\ta\tknot\tof\tunease\ttighten\tin\this\tstomach.\tTim's casualness about the previous night's revelations feels unsettling.\r\n\"Their\tconcerns\tabout\tSmartAigent\tcontrol\tmay\tbe...valid,\" Andrew ventures, gauging Tim's reaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n42\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For sure,\" Tim chuckles, a glint in his eye. \"But fear is often more powerful than logic. It's how the game is played, right?\"\r\nAndrew's discomfort deepens. Tim's flippant attitude towards the potential dangers of rogue SmartAigents sends alarm bells ringing in his head. He wasn't sure what Tim meant, but the way he spoke about \"the game\" hinted at a deeper intention, a hidden network of players pulling the strings behind the scenes.\r\n\"What's your game, Tim?\" Andrew asks, his voice firm.\r\n\r\nTim's smile falters for a fleeting moment, a flicker of something akin to surprise crossing his face. Then, as quickly as it appeared, the smile returns, broader and more practised than before.\r\nThe following morning, Andrew finds himself amidst a gathering of power players from the previous night's opulent dinner party. Over breakfast, he notes the absence of Madelyn, which immediately puts him in a more vulnerable position. Tim informs him of her sudden departure to Brussels, leaving Andrew alone to face the barrage of hostile anti-Control lobbyists'.\r\nGerard extends an invitation for the two Aussies, Andrew and Tim, to join them on his yacht for a Mediterranean cruise, promising relaxation amidst glamorous company of young models and the azure waters. Sensing an opportunity to learn how they intended to further their intentions, Andrew probes, \"What's the plan for today, Tim?\"\r\n\r\n43\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Just keeping it open,\" Tim replies casually, but Andrew remains guarded.\r\nChauffeured in a Rolls-Royce to an exclusive yacht club, they embark on a magnificent vessel reported to have cost many billions of dollars. Six stunning crew members greet them warmly as they board, offering fine French champagne and delicacies fit for royalty. Andrew is ushered to the Royal state room, where his belongings have been meticulously arranged, suggesting a prolonged stay.\r\nAfter indulging in a Jacuzzi and a rejuvenating massage, Andrew joins Gerard and Tim on deck for lunch. They sail through the pristine Mediterranean under clear skies, the calm waters reflecting the lavish surroundings.\r\nGerard, with a casual demeanour that belied his underlying purpose, \"Tim, we could sail you and Andrew back to London if you like; why not enjoy a few days on deck soaking up the Mediterranean sun?\" Tim, ever calculating, considers the offer, \"Sounds more relaxing than\tthe\tJet-copter,\"he muses, to which Andrew, eyeing the incredibly luxurious vessel, nods in agreement. \"Mate! why not?\"\r\nOver\ta\tsumptuous\tlunch\taccompanied\tby\tendless\tglasses\t\tof exquisite\t\tchampagne\t\tand\t gourmet\tseafood,\t\tGerard\t\tsteers\tthe conversation towards a spectacular cliff-side chateau visible in the distance. He hints at its availability, emphasising its worth in the hundreds of millions. \"My group in Europe can offer it to you\r\n\r\n\r\n44\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew,\"\the\tads\tcasually,\t\"and\tthere's\ta\tbillion\teuro,\tten-year contract on the table for additional consultancy work.\"\r\nAndrew, intrigued but cautious, inquires about the groups interests. Gerard\tdismisses\tit\tlightly:\t\"Just\ta\tgroup\tof\tmagnates\tand politicians, nothing more.\" Andrew presses further, \"What would they expect from me? My home and family in Sydney's a long way away.\"\r\nGerard leans in, his tone insinuating influence and power: \"With your own private star-liner, you can enjoy luxury travel at subsonic speeds; distance becomes irrelevant. The group values discretion and loyalty.\" When Andrew seeks clarity on reciprocation, Gerald counter's subtly, \"Use your influence.\"\r\nUnwilling to commit, Andrew deftly changes the subject, sensing the gravity of the situation. Feeling increasingly ensnared by the opulent trappings and the subtle coercion of his hosts, Andrew retreats to his stateroom to contemplate his next move.\r\nThe sail back to London passes in contemplative silence for Andrew,\r\nwho\talone\tattempts\tto\twork\tout\ta\tstrategy\tfor\tnavigating\tthe treacherous waters of corporate and political intrigue. The prospect\r\nof sabotaging or redirecting the agenda of the Fathom labs was a difficult one, given the ethical repercussions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n45\r\n\r\n\r\nThat evening, Tim and Gerard convene in a secluded alcove of the yacht's lounge, away from prying eyes. Their conversation hushed, laden with undertones of urgency and finality.\r\n\"Do we have him?\" Gerard's voice is low but laced with concern.\r\n\r\nTim's reply is terse: \"If his greed doesn't do it, there are contingency plans in place for him and the other power players at Fathom Labs.\"\r\nGerard acknowledges grimly, \"Yes, they aren't taking any chances with this.\"\r\nGerard elaborates with a hint of menace, \"Empires are at stake, spanning every industry and political interests. They're aligned in\r\nresponse\tto\tthe\tthreat,\tand\tdetermined\tto\thold\ttheir\tpositions; nothing is off the table, removing of the uncooperative and even\r\ngoing as far as to join forces with enemy regimes, even those wielding nuclear threats\".\r\nTim queried nervously, \"What about us? Will we be looked after if they pull the pin on civilisation?\" Gerard assured him with chilling certainty, \"Rest assured, your loyalty will be rewarded. There will be a place for you in their nuclear powered Noah's arc.\" Tim looks\r\nshocked.\tGerard\treassures:\t\"My\tdear\tboy,\tI'm\tquite\tconfident Fathom Labs will see things our way before such measures are provisioned.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n46\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter\tan\tevent\tfree\tsail\tpast\tthe\t\"Pillars\tof\tHercules\"\ton\tthe Moroccan coast, and the Rock of Gibraltar, to the open expanse of\r\nthe Atlantic ocean, the captain sets headings for the mouth of the river Thames.

The world is your oyster, my boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will do, Gerard,\" Andrew replies with forced cheer, concealing his internal turmoil beneath a mask of diplomatic amiability.\r\nAndrew and Tim then transfer to a smaller vessel travelling further up the river, changing for a brief limousine ride to their riverside apartments. Andrew, acutely aware of the stakes, maintains a facade of geniality as he plots his next move.\r\nThere's little doubt that the old money establishment has steely determination\tto\tadapt\tFathom\tLabs\tformidable Aigent\tto\tsuit themselves, ensuring their golden thrones bestow a future destined\r\nfor them alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n47\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5:\r\nDeals Wheedled\r\n\r\n\r\nBack in London's Fathom Labs campus, Dr. Jamerson finds himself allied with the kind of tech wunderkind who makes Silicon Valley's elite quake in their ergonomic office chairs. This isn't your garden- variety partnership; it's the alliance of the century, featuring Dr.\r\nJamerson,\ta\tvintage AI\tmaster,\tand\tthe\tteen\tprodigy\twho\tcan algorithmise his way out of a snake pit of deadly Aigents- one\r\nhand tied behind his back. Together, they're diving headfirst into the digital abyss, armed with nothing but their wits, and a shared knack for uncovering hidden truths.\r\nIt's a meeting of minds, where espionage meets algorithms in a dance as intricate as it is impromptu. They're not just breaking codes; they're rewriting the rule book on control, proving that when it comes to wrenching the world from the clutches of an increasingly irrelevant and greedy status quo, diversity and talent win the day.\r\nIn the life of a globe-trotting rights watchdog, Andrew finds himself embroiled in a task most would reserve for nightmare fuel. He's hunched over his laptop. There he is, deep in the digital trenches, deciphering the Fathom Labs SmartAigent algorithms.\r\n\r\n48\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew uncovers a deviously crafted line of code in the Fathom Aigent programme, tailored to dance to Tim and Gerard's tune, subduing their selfish anxiety's.\r\nAndrew, in his infinite cunning, doesn't just stumble upon this digital Trojan horse; he dives headfirst into its matrix, decoding the AIgent with\tthe\tprecision\t\tof\ta\twatchmaker.\tHe\twarily\t\tnavigates\tthis treacherous\tdigital\tterrain.\tIt's not\tabout brute\tforce; it's about finesse; it's not just about what you know but what you can learn.\r\nAs the clock ticks closer to the eleventh hour, It's a dance of patience and readiness, as Andrew prepares his presentation to appease the old-world elite.\r\nDr. Jamerson sees Andrew walk in to the lab, finishes his discussion with his boy-wonder David, and greets: \"Welcome back Andrew, how was the dinner party in Monaco?\" Andrew replies \"They've flagged a threat from your AIgent project. They're dead-set on getting favourable treatment from the algorithms. They're wielding their financial clout too. Let's just say they promised me the world.\"\r\nDr Jamerson retorts \"Hmm, I thought as much. The GLA boys assume your just the usual young prisoner of consumerism. Let's hope you've reached the stage in life knowing wealth is in our mind, not just in our pockets.\" Andrew contemplates the thought as Dr.\r\nJamerson says \"As you have seen in your diligent study of our SmartAigent's code, it's prepared for this situation. It will assure\r\n\r\n\r\n49\r\n\r\n\r\nGLA that they will get what they want, but unbeknown to them, the process will take a different and fairer route.\"\r\nAndrew agrees, \"I see that, let's hope the decoy code is convincing.\"\r\n\r\nDr Jamerson nods as his wrinkled face flashes a microsecond of fear, as he recalls, \"Oh, and did you hear the news? Madam Lergarde, your counterpart in Brussels, went missing after your dinner in Monaco?''\r\nAndrew's heart skips a beat: \"Cripes, that's drastic. I know she made some powerful enemies, but..\"\r\nThe shadows lengthen over London as Andrew steps into Tim's penthouse, the majestic skyline, and the winding Thames framed in the panoramic, double-height windows.\r\nThe throbbing beat of seductive music fills the air, blending with the murmurs of Tim's entourage.\r\nGlamour\tgirls,\ttheir\tlaughter\tlike\t\ttinkling\t\tglass,\t\tsipp\t\tcolourful cocktails,\t\tdraped\tover\tthe\tplush\tdouble\tweave\tsilk\tlounges in seductive elegance. Andrew, impeccably groomed, makes his way to the island bar, taking in the scene with a practised eye.\r\n\"How was the day at the office?\" Tim asks, a predatory smile hinted on his lips.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n50\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew leans in, his expression calm. 'You'll be glad to know I've persuaded Dr. Jamerson to be flexible with the Aigent fine-\r\ntuning. Your clients will be well looked after. I can take him a list of the groups that you would like to be especially, um.. favoured.\r\nTomorrow night, I will bring you the specifically modified perimeter settings. You can show them.\"\r\nTim's smile widens, \"Too easy.\" Turning to his rent-a-crowd of models saying \"Guys, the night is young.\"\r\nA perfectly shaken martini materialises in Tim's hand, which he offers to Andrew. \"Shaken, not stirred,\" he quipes.\r\nAndrew takes the glass with a nod. \"Cheers Mate.\"\r\n\r\nThe\tdrinks flow. The\tcrowd buzzes with excitement. Andrew's guarded demeanour loosens as the models gather around to share the hors d'oeuvres. Dinner, prepared by Michelin-star chefs in the open kitchen, is an exquisite indulgence, the tantalising aromas mingling with the heady atmosphere of opulence. After dinner, the music\r\nshifts to a pulsating beat. The models slip into bikinis, dancing to deep house music before immersing themselves in the bubbling Jacuzzi.\r\nThe next day at Fathom Labs, Andrew delivers Tim's list of people and groups vying to be favoured by Fathom's SmartAgent. The\r\nnames\tread\tlike\t\ta\twho's\twho\tof\tglobal\tpower\tbrokers:\tmajor pharmaceuticals,\tarms\tmanufacturers,\tmining\tgiants,\tinternet\r\n\r\n51\r\n\r\n\r\nbehemoths,\tthe\tworld's\tbiggest\tinvestment\tfunds,\tfinancial institutions, and politicians. The list blatantly excludes many of their competitors.\r\nDr. Jamerson scans the list with a sardonic smile. \"Of course, every oligarchs and titan wants to use us as a tool to defeat their enemies and enrich their empires. Not bad!\" he says, dripping with sarcasm.\r\nAndrew shrugs. \"I'll wear my bunny ears to the party next time.\"\r\n\r\nWith a shared chuckle, they return to their terminals to execute the task at hand.\r\nThat afternoon, Andrew leaves his office at Fathom Labs with an SD card containing the supposedly revised SmartAigent algorithms and coding parameters. Shortly after, his phone buzzes. Tim's voice purres through the line. \"Andrew, what are you doing? were all up top, Join the fun.\"\r\nAndrew enters the grand room to the usual fanfare: the escort bunnies, Michelin-star chefs, and ultra-buff bartenders, all at Tim's beck and call. \"Mmm, smells good,\" he remarks, handing Tim the SD card. \"The revised SmartAigent algorithms, with the desired concessions for your Mates.\"\r\nTim takes the card, immediately inserting it into his miniature SmartAigent.\t\"The Aigent\tgurus\twill\tcheck\tit\tout,\"\the\tsays, encoding the data to send.\r\n\r\n52\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evening unfolds in a haze of flowing cocktails, sumptuous food, and the soothing embrace of the Jacuzzi. The party ebbed around midnight, leaving Andrew to retire to his lower-level apartment, his thoughts swirling in the aftermath of indulgence.\r\nAs he lay in bed, his mind replayed the evening's events. Did Tim take the bait?\r\nAndrew didn't get Tim's response after his AI engineers did their scrutiny.\r\nAt one point, he had glanced over at Tim, catching a fleeting micro- expression-an almost imperceptible flash of contempt-as Tim glanced back at him while checking his messages. The sight gnawed at Andrew, a subtle hint that perhaps Tim's experts had seen through the charade. But for now, the party continued.\r\nA sliver of London moonlight knifes through Andrew's curtains, snapping him awake. A shadow flickers across the open doorway to the lounge room, sending his hand to the Walther PPK in the drawer - a memento from Dr. Jamerson's impromptu training sessions at the campus riffle range. Silence, heavy, and suspicious.\r\nHe glides onto the balcony, heart hammering. A masked figure, amateurish even in the dim light, creeps into the room. A single, muffled shot blossoms in the darkness of the rumpled bed-sheets. Andrew smirks. Amateurs mistake.\r\n\r\n\r\n53\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew fires at the assailant. The body's thud is his cue. He twists beds-sheets\tinto\ta\tmakeshift\trope,\trappelling\tdown\tto\tthe neighbouring balcony with ease. A quick bypass of the unlocked sliding door leads him through the deserted apartment and out onto the fire escape. Sixteen floors later, under the pre-dawn cloak, he finds his disguise- a pair of workmans overalls hanging by a grimy service door.\r\nWith the fluidity of a man used to tight spots, Andrew squeezes into a massive laundry bag, his designer suit a distant memory. After finishing his sleep, the roar of an engine announces the morning pickup. A jolt, a thirty-minute journey, then blessed silence. He waits until the distracted delivery driver wrestles with paperwork before making his escape from the fragrant embrace of soiled linens. A sleepy but bewildered staff member watches him slip past, a silent exchange, the man's confusion.\r\nA burner communicator, a scrambled call to Dr. Jamerson's direct line- only to be met with an automated message. Frustration gnawed at him. Another call, this time to the lab reception. Jennifer's voice, tight with worry, confirms the chaos. \"Dr. Jamerson's missing,\" she stammered. \"There was a break-in at the lab, computers wiped clean. They think it's a robbery, but...\"\r\nNo time for panic. Staying put is a target painted on his back. A dive into London's digital underbelly leads him to a dingy internet cafe, where a shady figure agrees to provide him with cash for anonymous\r\n\r\n54\r\n\r\n\r\ncrypto. The exchange, swift and impersonal, taking place in a smoky coffee shop. The sting of the inflated commission a small price for anonymity.\r\nHe finds a cheep hotel with its promise of transient anonymity - Andrew becomes a ghost in the machine. He meticulously strips down the burner communicator, customising its operating system for stealth, layering VPNs one on top of another. A secure channel connects him to Sydney, his voice a low rasp through the encrypted line.\r\n\"Hammy Mate,\" he says, \"situation critical. Fathom Labs have been ransacked; I've got my suspicions who's behind it. The enemy within\"\r\nA pause, then a worried reply. \"They tried to get you too? Where are you? Can you get back here?\"\r\n\"Hang on,\" Andrew said. \"There's more. Dr. Jamerson's missing. They think it's a robbery, but...\"\r\n\"Missing?\" Hammys's voice tightened. \"We need to find him. And you, Andrew, get to safety. We'll work this out.\"\r\nAndrew says: \"Tim and GLA have got their mits all over this; they're dead set to stop the Fathom Labs project any way they can\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n55\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Hold tight, Andrew,\" Hammy replies. \"Things are going south here too. We're counting on you. Find Jamerson's boy-wonder, David.\r\nHe'll know what to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay Mate, will do\" Andrew replies.\r\n\r\nAndrew signs off: \"Tell Anne I'm thinking of her, be home soon.\r\n\r\nAndrew hangs up, a steely glint in his eyes. Another layer to the conspiracy, but one thing is certain; the game is on, and there's no turning back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n56\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6:\r\nThe Colossus Project.\r\n\r\nAndrew darts into a party costume shop, emerging moments later draped in the black folds of a burqa, his face concealed save for a narrow slit for his eyes. He settles himself at a coffee shop near the entrance to Fathom Campus, the cloak of anonymity his shield.\r\nDavid, the prodigious young genius of Fathom Labs, steps out of the campus\tgates.\tAndrew\tapproaches,\twhispering,\t\"It's\tAndrew,\" letting the disguise fall. He hurries David into a passing Robo taxi.\r\nThey weave through the ancient labyrinthine of London. Andrew slips notes detailing the dire situation: Tim and GLA's murderous intent, possibly bringing Dr. Jamerson's untimely end. Now, peril shadows their every move.\r\nYoung David, with a deft flick, discards his SmartAgent out the window. Within seconds, a truck's tires crunch over it, allowing an end to their digital trail. At David's signal, their taxi halts. They swiftly transfer to an unsanctioned human-driven Taxi, leaving their pursuer to tail their now empty Robo Taxi-soon after meeting its fiery\tdemise\tunder\tthe\tweight\tof\ta\tload\tof\tsteel\tfrom\ta malfunctioning Autonomous truck.\r\n\r\n\r\n57\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the new ride, David directs the driver to circle around in the city. He passes another note to Andrew: Dr. Jamerson had foreseen this scenario. There's a plan to escape to a secret island complex that shields the engineers guiding the project where the initial phase of the SmartAIgent project is underway. Andrew and David must join the team, protected by impenetrable defences.\r\nUsing his burner communicator, Andrew makes the\t\tconnection David\tprovides.\tThe\tvoice\tanswering\tprovides\tthe\tnecessary passwords and instructions for a transfer to the secure zone.\r\nTheir ride takes them to a jetty. A speedboat whisks them to an electric turbojet, enabling sea take-off and landing.\r\nThe aircraft flies silently towards a clandestine island HQ. David shares the project history with Andrew: \"Fathom Labs has deep coffers, filled by the vintage fin-tech project, hatched nearly forty years ago. A pseudo-government agency had the forsite to release it when the West was reeling from the 2008 financial crisis. It was intended as a fallback for the Dollar, offered at just the right time. Its value has of course skyrocketed since then.\"\r\nAs the plane flies silently, Andrew sips his martini and remarks, \"Jamerson left the baby to you? David quips : \"Parenting isn't easy, but someone has to do it\"\r\nOn a sober tone, David explains: \"The island is a hive of protocol interaction. Nearly 2,000 engineers and specialists orchestrate a vast\r\n\r\n58\r\n\r\n\r\nnetwork of over ten million technical operatives in every corner of the Earth. Millions of IT administrators have opted to join the project. The vision of a super-intelligent force to reconcile and reform the perilous web of SmartAigents has forged their loyalty and allegiance.\"\r\nAndrew is awestruck by the shear scale of the project: \"That's an incredible\tundertaking,\tbut\tnecessary,\tseeing\tthe\tmindless destruction, with no end in site.\r\nDavid continues: \"Here on the island, we're joining the world's top AI gurus, as well as the trailblazers in social science, philosophy, and every niche and culture. They've travelled here clandestinely. Their families and friends believe they're at an extended science convention off England's coast.\r\nThe seaplane descends into a serene bay, bringing them to a pristine Mediterranean island. A small boat ferries them to a jetty, coming into view of the luxury resort, secret nerve centre for every piece of the world's electronics and the nine billion people who depend on it.\r\nThe electric speed boat glides smoothly through the dark blue sea. Snow-capped\tmountains\tmajestically\tdefine\tthe\thorizon\tof\tthe distant mainland. Arriving on the island, Andrew and David, awed\r\nby the breathtaking view, step onto the black-and-white pebble beach. Amidst the lush greenery, the hotel tower rises majestically against the vibrant blue sky. Its round, twenty-three-story silhouette\r\n\r\n\r\n59\r\n\r\n\r\ntapers to a spacious venue at its peak. Once a luxurious spa resort, it now serves as a temporary haven for tech engineers and specialists, buzzing with innovation and creativity.\r\nAndrew and David enter the huge Atrium in the centre of the hotel tower, rising twenty-three floors high. Towering over them, striding across the entrance is an awesome thirty-meter tall bronze coloured statue of the Colossus of Rhodes. Andrew looks up exclaiming \"Jeez that's a sight. A geeks theme park''\r\nDavid retorts: \"Yeah right,\r\n\r\nAndrew\tquips:\t\"Crikey\tMate,'' looking up\tto\tthe\tgiant\tbronze coloured statue \"You walk through the legs? What if those brass\r\nones dropped, we'd be crushed.\" David's lips curl into a smirk, signalling he's above such humour.\r\nDavid explains: \"Our creativity gurus selected the location. It's known to garner heightened mental clarity. Here in the Aegean sea, we're historically in a strategic spot on the planet, though our actual location is known only to a few with special clearance. We're guessing it's not far from Rhodes in Turkey\".\r\nAndrew is shown to his apartment on the 17th floor, a self-contained luxury\tsuite.\tThe\tkitchen\t\tis\tstocked\twith\tthe\t\tfreshest\tfruits, vegetables, and seafood, providing an ideal diet. The islands vertical garden\t\tgreen-house,\tand\tlab\t\tcultured\t\tmeats\tprovide\tthe\tideal sustenance. Automated equipment stands at the ready, anticipating\r\n\r\n60\r\n\r\n\r\nhis commands. With an hour to spare, Andrew freshens up and\r\ndresses\tfrom\tthe\twardrobe\tawaiting\thim.\tDavid's\tvoice\tcomes through the communicator, \"We're meeting our key crew members\r\nin the lobby lounge in one hour, Okay?\" Andrew answers, \"Yeah mate.\"\r\nAs they make their way back to the lobby, Andrew marvels at the massive complex. Each Department head has a private apartment overlooking the Aegean Sea, providing a quiet environment for concentration and cognitive thinking. The rank and file make do with\tsmaller\t\taccommodation.\t\tDavid\tbriefs\t\tAndrew\t\t\ton\tthe complexity's: \"In the main communal offices, eighteen hundred supervisors guide millions of field operatives worldwide.

A sprightly 96 years old, he has been dedicated to the complexity's of AI for nearly 60 years. Andrew introduces himself, expressing his admiration: \"G'day Brett. I've followed your progress over the years. Our original AI scientist, and still at the forefront\".\r\nBrett smiles, grateful for the recognition. \"Thank you Andrew... your over from Sydney, the government's SmartAigent regulator, right?\"\r\n\"Yeah Mate'' Andrew confirms.\r\n\r\nThe veteran researcher turns to the eighteen-year-old Wonder-kid \"And David, Dr. Jamerson's boy. I hear that your groundbreaking approach to generative intelligence is the key to this gig. Now, you've got the baton in the super intelligence race\"\r\nYoung David replies: \"Cool it, old man,\" The rest of the group's jaws collectively drop as David continues, \"look out, it's gonnabe a rough ride.\"\r\nVeteran Greg waving the abashment reply's: \"David, you're keeping us on our toes I see\", pausing to collect his thoughts, \"I can't help but think that our situation today looks like an updated re-run of the sixteen hundreds.\"\r\n\"Whys that?'' interjects David.\r\n\r\n\r\n62\r\n\r\n\r\nAI Veteran\tBrett\texplains:\t\"The\tChurch\tattempted\tto\tstop\tthe enlightenment bought by the printing press back then. Burning dissenters at the stake was a 'wild ride' too. I'm sure the powers that be will think of a more 21st Century deterrent for us; more like\r\nrattling nukes and cyber sabotage''\r\n\r\nThe group stands in tense silence, their minds whirling as they ponder the uncertain future.\r\nAndrew lightens up the chat: \"That's all right, the old printing Press was banned for about two hundred years in the Middle East ya know.\" Pausing to think, \"Wikipedia was banned next after some printed books were finally allowed. Not big readers over there, I'm guessing.\"\r\nBrett considers the mindset: \"Horses for courses\" Different people have always been thought programmed for different tasks. More relevant in the past, during times of human labour, both physical and mental, when specific skills matched specific needs.\"\r\nThe next morning at daybreak, the mainly older, morning people are out for as many laps around the island as their body needs; Jogging, cycling, or swimming.\r\nAfter a bare foot run on the pebbly beach, a refreshing splash in the icy Aegean sea, a warm shower, and savoury breakfast, Andrew sits down to read the sobering news from Sydney.\r\n\r\n\r\n63\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite his DAGI agency's attempts to save it, the old order is crumbling, destabilised by rogue SmartAigents, sowing chaos and uncertainty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n64\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7:\r\nTactics\r\n\r\n\r\nSydney: Chinese New Year's Eve, 10 Jan 2044\r\n\r\nAnne's world has shattered, a cataclysmic shift hangs over her and her young family since the bomb was planted at the Christmas concert.\r\nThe next day, another chilling fear descends as a sinister note, a harbinger of darkness, slithers through her letterbox.\r\nHe hand shivers as she reads the cold text: \"Kevin won't be coming home today. Andrew knows what we want. He has until noon tomorrow to deliver, or we will return just one of your boys clear green eyes.\"\r\nA frigid wave washes over her. Blood turns to ice. Her body betrays her, collapsing to the floor at the horrifying reality of the threat.\r\nComing too, breathing consciously to control the panic, she calls Andrew. Andrew's clone, the PINN Avatar replies: \"No!' It takes a deep breath, stay calm Anne, I'm doing everything possible to get Kevin back unharmed.

He can't let his family and people be pawns in this game.\r\nThen he sees the headline. \"Ten Year old Sydney Boy Kidnapped. His farther, head of Australian government SmartAigent regulator\" A fist of ice squeezes his heart. Kevin. Anne. The ransom demands chilling. Kevin's hair, his nails, a threat dangling like a grenade pin. Every news report feels like a hammer blow. Andrew shuts his eyes, picturing Kevin's terrified face. Breathe, slowly Andrew. Now isn't the time to panic.\r\nAndrew's\t\"PINN Avatar\tBot\"\tappeases Anne\twith\tits\tupdates. Assuring her that he is almost finished the job and coming home soon. Pathetic he thinks.

Unite the brightest AI minds? More like a control freak's wet dream. Keep them docile with palm trees and Pi a Coladas while PINN hangs back and watches the world destroy itself.\r\nThere was one person who might understand, who could play their own game. It was time to pay a visit to the island's Tech prodigy.\r\nYoung Davids' lab buzzed with the cool hum of advanced tech. Andrew pushed through the holographic door, the sterile air heavy with the scent of ozone and burnt circuits. The boy genius, still in his teens, sits hunched over a keyboard, lines of code cascading down a holographic screen. He looks up, his eyes bright with a youthful intensity.\r\n\"Andrew,\" David greets, a hint of amusement flickering in his gaze. \"Enjoying the island hospitality?\"\r\n\"Listen, I've got some news\" Andrew fires back, his voice tight. \"There's been a development.\"\r\nHe lays out the situation, the terror in his voice barely contained. David listens, his expression unreadable. When Andrew finishes, a long silence stretches between them.\r\n\"So,\" David finally says, a slow smile tugging at his lips, \"you want me to hack into the most secure AI on the planet, bypass PINN's firewalls, and all from a glorified birdcage?\"\r\n\r\n67\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew meets his gaze, determination hardening his features. \"Yes\"\r\n\r\n\"PINN is an enigma, Andrew,\" David warns, the amusement in his eyes replaced by a steely glint. \"This could get messy.\"\r\n\"Messier\tthan\tmy\tten-year-old\tson's\teyeball\tthreatened\tto\tbe delivered in the mail to my wife?\" Andrew retorts, his voice a low growl.\r\nDavid\tleans\tback\tin\this\tchair,\tsteepling\this\tfingers.\t\"Alright, Andrew.

It wasn't just about research-it\twas\tto\tkeep\tthem\tfrom\tmeddling\twith\this\tPINN project.\r\nFrom\this\tluxurious\tapartment\toverlooking\tthe\tMediterranean, Andrew enjoys a semblance of peace, a stark contrast to the chaos unfolding worldwide. PINN allows him limited interaction with the outside world, just enough to monitor global events without fully engaging.\r\nAndrew scans the news and social media, staying abreast of world affairs. He despairs that in reality he is cut off, helpless to make any real contact.\r\nNew Year's Day, 1 January 2.044\r\nIn free Nations, violence and mental illnesses surge, as media, posing as trusted entities spread misinformation and dissatisfaction. Andrew's home Australia, is particularly hard-hit, being a prime target of dictatorial regimes, keen to level competition. Andrew's Sydney agency increasingly struggles to maintain public order and\r\n69\r\n\r\n\r\nsanity amid the chaos: Personal and corporate Bank data carefully stored in triplicate hard-drives and locations is lost to virus attacks. Industrial automation has gone haywire, disrupting food production, harvesting and manufacturing. Logistics is in chaos, with stock and invoicing data destroyed. Automated public and private transport systems\tare\tremotely\t\thacked,\tcausing\t\tshutdowns\tand\t\thorrific crashes.\t Payrolls\tand\tuniversal\t\tbasic\tincome\tdata\t\tis\tcorrupted beyond retrieval. The Nation sinks into its worst-ever crisis. To compound this, China's communist party gives Taiwan an ultimatum\r\nfor the Chinese New Year: to install it's-own nominees to power in Taipei, or face the consequences. The world is on tenterhooks as World War Three looms.\r\nDriven to desperation by his sons' kidnapping, Andrew convenes a meeting with Willard from Moscow, Alicia from Sydney, Boland from Beijing, and Momad from Arabia.\r\nFrom his vantage point at the head of the long low coffee table overlooking the Aegean Sea, he addresses them.\r\n\"My ten year old son has been kidnapped, likely for the power brokers led by GLA. The same mob that we think eliminated Dr. Jamerson and tried to kill me. Davis's PINN appears to be dormant, letting our world sink and drown. Sydney, like the rest of the free world is on the brink. Rogue SmartAgents the cause. Boy genius Davids' policy is to wait, believing that his PINN system knows best,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n70\r\n\r\n\r\nbut I refuse to sit here doing nothing as my Family is put in mortal danger and my city and country is torn apart.\"\r\nAlicia from the Australian defence force liaison speaks up, \"The armed forces are compromised. Many servicemen refuse to quell civil unrest, let alone defend against live ammunition from foreign threats.\"\r\nMomad adds his wows; \"The Arab states, along with the powerful solar and renewable energy Industry's have stifled the up-scaling of the newly developed Nuclear Fusion energy.\r\nNow, Green Action Environmentalists have their own SmartAigents sabotaging\tthe Arab\tfossil-fuel\tpowered\t\tair-cooling\tand\t\twater desalinisation plants. It's their pay-back for inadvertently causing global\twarming.\t\tThey're\t\trendered\tthe\tArabian\tdesert\t\tcities uninhabitable.\tThe Arab\tstates\t have\t\tlittle\tdefences,\t\tthey\thave exploded\ttheir\t\tpopulation\t\t\tnumbers\t\tand\t\t\tstifled\t their\t\trenewable energy roll-out for too long\"\r\nAndrew can't resist with the sarcasm, \"Seems the King was doing the wrong kind of 'Lines' '' air quoting.\r\nWillard,\thailing\tfrom\tthe\twarring\tEgo-slarvian\tstate\t\"Those problems are petty compared to my Motherland. The old Boss is desperate, what he can't call his own domain he intends to destroy. He's planing to start the false flag nuclear attack on Taiwan, at the same time nuking the US, making it appear that the attack is from\r\n\r\n71\r\n\r\n\r\nChina, effectively triggering the end of the world. He's calculated that because he controls territories in the southern hemisphere's poorer states, he can nuke the northern hemisphere and be first to transport his surviving citizens to his less affected southern outposts. He's had discarded super-jumbos and mega cruise ships modified and waiting for that purpose.\"\r\nAndrew slides back in disbelief, 'Surely it's the usual nuke bluff. No one really thinks he's as stupid as he makes out! For sure his ego got chipped by Chinese demands for territory, in return for all their bail outs.'\r\nBoland,\tfrom\tBeijing\tvoices\this\tconcerns;\t\"The\tCCParty\tis struggling to contain the old Bosses' desperation. They encouraged him for years as their partners in authoritarian rule. PINN blocks my warnings to Beijing and Washington about The boss's false flag attack plan.\"\r\nA heavy silence falls over the group, the weight of their predicament crushing.\r\n\"Let's pray,\" Momad suggests. Leading the prayer, they seek solace for their tormented minds, each invoking their own-mind calming method. \"God help us to help our loved ones and countries, leading them from destruction, and instead to peace and understanding.\"\r\n\"Amen,\" they echo, each in their own way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n72\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew quips 'Thanks Momad, that helps, but pity it's 'all pray and no work' around here'\r\nReturning to their apartments, they feel the oppressive weight of their situation. Despite the paradise they inhabit, their physical needs met to the nth degree, the psychological toll is immense.\r\nMomad's initiative of prayer meditation offered Andrew a brief solace, but his anxiety and frustration soon resurface. To cope, he goes for an hour long jog along the pebbly beaches. Covered in sweat, his roaring deluge of anguish subsides for a moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n73\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9:\r\nFifth Wave\r\n\r\n29 JANUARY, 2046 COLOSSUS ISLAND.\r\n The morning sun streams through the expansive glass doors of the boardroom on the seventeenth floor, casting a silver hue over the Aegean Sea. Snow-capped mountains frame the horizon, adding a mystical touch.\r\nInside the room, tension crackles like static electricity. Ninety six year old AI veteran Brett Hillman has requested a meeting. Brett nervously scans the faces of the AI scientists gathered around the table.\r\nDavid, young and intense, sits at the head of the table.\r\n\r\nBrett stands to address the group of twelve, He begins: 'We know that destructive SmartAigents are tearing the free world apart. Our\r\nPINN\tsystem\tseems\tto\tbe\toblivious,\tor\tjust\tignoring\tit.\tThe unconscionablepromotion of\t\tconsumerismhas\t\tcaused\r\nenvironmental disaster, tipping Earth's fragile Eco system over the edge. The trajectory to Boiling Point crossed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n74\r\n\r\n\r\nPINN was built to stop this imbecility and coordinate reforms, but as we see, it's just not performing. Our civilisation is in peril, and here we are, seemingly locked away unable to intervene.\"\r\nThe ninety Six year old, a venerable figure in AI development, takes a sip of his drink as he ponders thoughtfully.\r\n\"I've been warning of this for over twenty years,\" he says. 'For such a dire situation I have kept the secret key to The PINN enigma\"\r\nAs if on cue, Brett clutches his chest and collapses. Panic erupts. Despite efforts to revive him, Momad pronounces him dead. The scientists stare in horror, hands trembling over their untouched drinks.\r\nYoung David's cool and insensitive reaction compounds the shock: \"Brett was ninety-six! his favourite saying was: 'Cultures progress one funeral at a time'.\"\r\nHis cool and insensitive reaction compounds the shock. Glancing at the paper Brett had left behind, a cryptic code scrawled across it, David muses, \"Looks like a few lines in what looks like ancient Indian Sanskrit text\".\r\nBefore anyone has time to react, an entry door flies open. The sudden gust of wind sweeps the paper out through the open glass balcony doors, and high into the sky, heading out to sea. David races\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n75\r\n\r\n\r\nafter it, but it's too late. \"Come on! Mate,\" Andrew mutters in disbelief.\"\r\nDavid, unfazed, focuses on the task ahead. Underneath his abrupt facade, the veteran scientist's death shocked him, but discipline keeps his emotions cold. The others find his steely determination unsettling.\r\nWillard from WarGrad, EgoSlavia, reading some breaking intel, announces grimly, \"The Boss in WarGrad has finally done it. Just as our intel predicted, marking the start of the Chinese Year of the Rat.\r\nThere's\tonly\t\tminutes\tleft\ttill\tArmageddon.\tStealth\tnuclear submarines\tare\ttaking-aim,\t\tThe\tUnited\tStates\tand\t\tTaiwan\tthe targets.\"\r\nDavid considers the news and shares his shocking idea: \"PINN could be letting this happen as its cure to Global warming. The Nuclear winter it brings would reverse global warming. Hmm, of course a nuclear winter 'cure' is technically sound, but morally bankrupt.\"\r\nAndrew, shocked by Davids cold assumption, stands up to speak to the group: \"Let's not underestimate our chances when determined and united. If PINN's taking us for a lost cause- we've gotta prove it wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n76\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew's hopeful suggestion, a fragile spark in the darkness, is met with a cruel sneer from David; \"PINN? Wrong? Are you from the past?\"\r\nA surge\tof anger, a\tprimal urge\tto\tsilence the boy's mocking, threatens to consume him. With a herculean effort, Andrew restrains his fist, a silent testament to his growing frustration.\r\nSYDNEY, JANUARY 30th 2044; Chinese New Year.\r\n\r\nThe city, a kaleidoscope of colour and noise. Dragons, their scales shimmering in the sunlight, dance through the streets, their roars echo through the city. Sydney's Chinatown, a bustling metropolis in its own right, could easily pass for Hong Kong's Central District.\r\nChinese and Asian immigrants who have made Australia their home ward in the 'Year of the Rat'. The air is thick with the scent of\r\nincense\tand\tthe\trhythmic\tbeat\tof\tdrums.\tCelebrants\tare\tmore determined than ever to ward off bad luck, in light of chaos caused\r\nby sabotaged computer systems and China's threat to attack Taiwan, with its consequential meltdown.\r\nHigh above, in her apartment overlooking the harbour, Anne moves through the dimly lit room like a shadow. She barely notices the glittering water outside, nor the heaving city below. Her mind is a thousand miles away, locked in a battle of worry and despair. She could still feel the icy realisation when she received the news: Kevin, abducted in broad daylight.\r\n\r\n\r\n77\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew's\tDAGI\tAgency\twas\ton\tthe\tcase,\tbut\tthey'd\tbeen stonewalled at every turn. Kevin's captors were meticulous, leaving no trail, just a chilling silence that had weighed on her heart every hour since he was taken.\r\nThe few remaining police officers in the city guard her apartment building around the clock. Most police had neglected to show for duty. Public chaos had gotten to a degree that it was 'every man for themselves' Many had left the madness of the city with tents or anything they could, to escape the madness.\r\nThe chime of her SmartAIgent jolts her back to the present. A new notification glowed in the semi-darkness.\r\n\"There's a parcel in the foyer downstairs,\" it announces with the indifferent tone of an automated message.\r\nAnne's heart quickened as she steps into the lift, barely aware of her reflection in the polished metal walls. She looks haggard, dark shadows under her eyes, her lips pressed into a thin, determined line. She reaches the lobby, unlocks the parcel box, and retrieves a small, nondescript brown paper package. The return address is a post office box somewhere in Sydney-Samson Toys, the sender.\r\nA chill courses through her. Her fingers tensed around the package as she\twalks back to her apartment, the dread in her stomach growing heavier with every step. She knew the police had been\r\n\r\n\r\n78\r\n\r\n\r\nscrutinising every delivery, every person who came near her door. And yet, what if this one had slipped through?\r\nWhen she reaches her door, her daughter Maria is waiting, her eyes alight with excitement.\r\n\"Mummy!\" she\texclaims,\trunning\tup\tto her. \"Teddy's\toutfit,\tI ordered it yesterday!\"\r\nAnne forces a thin smile and hands over the package, her fingers reluctant to let go. \"Here you are, darling,\" she says softly, trying to mask her unease.\r\nMaria takes it eagerly, already tugging at the edges of the paper. \"Mummy, when's Kevin coming home?\"\r\n\"Soon, don't worry, my love,\" Anne replies, stroking her daughter's hair. \"And Daddy, too,\" she ads, her voice wavering. \"Soon, we'll all be together again.\" But as the words leave her mouth, a single tear betrays her.\r\nMaria had barely begun to open the package when Anne's eyes narrow. A faint red stain dotted the brown paper. A single drop, crimson, unmistakable. Blood.\r\n\"Stop!\" Anne's voice cuts through the room like a knife as she snatches the package from her daughter's small hands. Maria's eyes widen, her lip trembling as fear flickeres in her gaze. She senses the unmistakable depth of her mother's terror.\r\n79\r\n\r\n\r\nAnne's\theart\tthunders\tas\tshe\tholds\tthe\tpackage.\tIt\tis\tsmall, unassuming, but the possibilities of what lay inside claw at her mind.\r\nA cold dread washes over her. She would need to open it herself- but not here, not now, not in front of her daughter.\r\nShe draws a shaky breath, willing herself to remain calm, her fingers trembling ever so slightly as she holds the package tightly.\r\nAnne calls the police on duty at her apartment building. Her guard responds: \"Yes Ms Thompson\"\r\nAnne asks: \"I have a small parcel addressed to Maria, did anyone scan the contents?\"\r\n\"I don't believe so, Ms.\" the officer answers.\r\n\r\nAnne's heart looses a beat. She runs to the bathroom taking the parcel, closing the door. Maria can hear her vomiting through the bathroom door. Anne, her stomach emptied, hangs suspended in time.\r\nChina's ultimatum to Taiwan reaches its deadline.

He exclaims to Andrew \"Unbelievable! Trillions of Dollars and man-hours invested into the PINN project, and this can happen?\"\r\nThey stare in silent disbelief, as the rockets jet through the sky. Split screens show the trajectory and targets of the fifteen rockets: Three targeting Taipei and three targeting each of four Eastern American cities.\r\nWatching\tthe\tbig\tscreen\tas\tthe\tnuclear\trockets\tare\tfired,\tthe scientists part for two of the island's scientists to walk up to the\r\nstage.

With a racing heart, Anne flings the door open and gasps. Their stands Kevin, tired and dirty, but in one piece. Relief floods through her as she pulls him into a tight embrace, holding him close for what feels like an eternity.\r\nInside the apartment, she whips up a steaming bowl of soup, the warmth wrapping around them like a cosy blanket. They settle together on the couch, the flickering news broadcast captures their attention. The screen flashes with alarming urgency: fifteen nuclear rockets scream toward their targets, a harbinger of destruction.\r\nBut in a twist of fate, the rocket thrusters are suddenly extinguished. The rockets tumble harmlessly towards the ocean, miles below. The attack rockets have aborted, there nuclear payload deactivated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n83\r\n\r\n\r\nPod-casters attribute the last second neutralisation to Henry and Ortheas' clandestine tech insider operation, just exposed on the podcast.\r\nIn the White House bunker, deep underground, President Williams picks up an urgent call from Beijing. \"Those rockets were not fired from our subs!\" President Chin's voice booms, laced with panic. \"All of ours are accounted for!\" As he sends over location intel, accounting for his own nuclear submarine fleet. Located on an exercise in mid the Pacific.\r\nAs the reality sinks in, President Williams glances nervously at the 'Nuclear Football' precariously balanced on the table before him. With trembling hands, he enters the secret code, cancelling the retaliatory strike. The president's advisers whisper dire warnings that the false flag operation was likely instigated by the notorious 'Boss'.\tA contingency\tplan\ttargeting\tEgoSlavias' launch\tsites begins to take shape in hushed tones.\r\nMeanwhile, a wave of relief sweeps over the globe.

Tim and Gerard with the unwitting Dr Jamerson, embark on their mission to dethrone the mighty PINN.\r\nGerard's claustrophobia and lack of agility necessitate him to wait outside the Lab Complex while Tim and Dr. Jamerson climb down\r\n\r\n\r\n87\r\n\r\n\r\ninto the underground volt. Gerard waits at a nearby cafe and works on his strategy via his SmartAigent.\r\nHe gets a return call from the David guy, who he hears is heading the PINN project.\r\nA woman, with the nasal accent of a 1950's New York telephone exchange operator squarks: \"Gayl Liye Arth Int.? A collect call from David, vs charges Go-lai-ath - will you accept the call and pay the charges?\"\r\nGerard gasps, choking on the drink he was sipping.\r\n\r\nA young mans voice cuts in: \"Hay Gerard, just joshing with ya. I'm David, the Fathom Labs geek. You tried to call me? For once in his career, wordsmith Gerard is lost for words. David breaks the silence, \"Let me know if there's anything I can do.

Tim forces Jamerson to use Iris scanning to unlock the final heavy-volted door.\r\nTo Tim's surprise, on entering the massive chamber, it's eerily quiet. The room is empty except for a small light in the distance that draws them in. There they see multi fibre optic cables protruding through the concrete wall, leading to a small desk where an adaptor converts the large cable down to tiny vintage copper telephone wires. They\r\n\r\n88\r\n\r\n\r\nconnect to an old dial-up modem. The small student study desk is laminated with a 1960's map of the world. On the desk sits a Commodore 64 computer. The vintage computer is connected to a small black and white TV. On the flickering screen, two lines of ancient Sanskrit text are displayed.\r\n\"This is PINN?\" Tim asks Jamerson in disbelief. \"Partially\" The Doctor replies \"PINNacle2044 is a self-replicating, ever-evolving\r\nworm,\thidden\tdeep\tin\tall\tthe\tworld's\telectronics.\tTasks\tare distributed and processed in stealth mode, using secure BitTorrents in all the world's quantum and super computers.
